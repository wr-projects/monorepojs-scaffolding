# [{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}](https://github.com/wr-projects/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}) RFCs

## What is an RFC ?

The RFC (request for comments) process is intented to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the project.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

## When to follow this process ?

You need to follow this process if you intend to make substantial changes to project.

What constitutes as substantial change is evolving based on community norms.

Some changes do not require an RFC:

- Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality criteria (performance, quality of life)
- Fixing objectively incorrect behavior
- Rephrasing, reorganizing or refactoring
- Addition or removal of warnings

If you have any questions regarding when to follow this process, please join us in the [Discord Channel]({{ cookiecutter.discord_url }}) or [Github Discussions](https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_repo_url }}/discussions).
